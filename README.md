Phase 1: Overlay extension for synced anime streaming platform

# 🌌 Peak – Synchronized Streaming Overlay Extension

**Peak** is an early-stage browser extension and web companion designed to create shared, real-time viewing experiences for anime fans and streaming enthusiasts. It overlays streamer facecams, chat, and reactions on top of official streaming services like Crunchyroll, allowing fans to sync and watch episodes together — without rebroadcasting or illegally hosting content.

> ⚠️ This project is in early development and is intended for demonstration and concept testing purposes only.

## 🧪 Disclaimer

This project does **not host, rebroadcast, or distribute copyrighted content**.  
All playback is expected to occur on a user’s own streaming service account (e.g. Crunchyroll, Netflix, Hulu), and overlays are displayed independently using browser extension logic.

This is an independent fan-made prototype with no affiliation to Crunchyroll or any streaming provider.
